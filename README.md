# Mapping Evaluative Language to Emotional States and Needs: Generative AI with Machine Learning Models for Psychological Chatbots


### Introduction

The study of emotions and their underlying needs is a critical component of understanding human communication, particularly in contexts such as psychology, nonviolent communication (NVC), and conflict resolution. Emotional states often manifest as evaluative expressions—terms like "betrayed," "belittled," or "manipulated"—which not only convey subjective experiences but also point to unmet needs such as trust, respect, or autonomy. Effectively mapping these evaluative expressions to their associated feelings and corresponding needs is vital for creating tools that enhance emotional understanding and foster constructive dialogue.

In the context of psychological analysis, therapy, or conflict mediation, practitioners often encounter patients or participants expressing evaluative words during discussions. For example, a patient may express feeling "betrayed," which corresponds to emotional clusters such as "angry," "hurt," and "disappointed," and points to unmet needs like "trust," "dependability," and "honesty." Accurately decoding these relationships enables more targeted interventions, improves mutual understanding, and supports emotional well-being.

The problem of mapping evaluative expressions to clusters of feelings and their associated needs, however, is non-trivial. Evaluative words are context-dependent, and their associated feelings and needs often vary across individuals and situations. Current approaches for addressing this problem rely heavily on manual analysis and subjective interpretation, which are time-intensive and prone to inconsistencies. This research aims to automate and enhance this process by leveraging computational methods to create robust models capable of identifying and mapping these relationships.

By framing the problem within the broader context of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, this study proposes four solutions: probabilistic topic modeling (LDA), clustering-based approaches (K-Means), embedding-based models (e.g., BERT), and fine-tuning large language models (e.g., Meta LLaMA 3 8B). Each approach is evaluated based on its ability to cluster feelings, predict needs, and generalize to unseen evaluative terms.

The significance of this research lies not only in its potential to streamline emotional analysis in psychological and therapeutic settings but also in its broader application to human-computer interaction. Building models capable of decoding evaluative expressions lays the foundation for emotionally intelligent systems, enabling more empathetic interactions in applications ranging from virtual therapists to educational tools.

This paper explores the mathematical underpinnings, computational methods, and practical applications of these approaches, comparing their strengths and limitations to provide a comprehensive framework for solving this complex and impactful problem.


### **Status of the Problem**

Understanding and addressing human emotions, particularly through language, is a fundamental challenge in psychology, communication studies, and artificial intelligence. Evaluative expressions such as "betrayed" or "belittled" often carry deep emotional and psychological implications. However, decoding these expressions into actionable insights like associated **Feeling(s)** and **Need(s)** remains a non-trivial task due to the following challenges:

1. **Ambiguity in Language**:
   - Evaluative words often depend on context for interpretation, and the same word can have different emotional implications for different individuals.

2. **Cluster Complexity**:
   - Emotional states are inherently multidimensional, and clustering evaluative expressions into feelings and needs requires sophisticated models capable of handling semantic and contextual nuances.

3. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Real-time applications, such as psychologist chatbots, demand efficient models that can infer emotional states and generate responses promptly without compromising accuracy.

### **Key Elements to Understand the Problem**

#### **1. Evaluative Words and Their Mapping**
Evaluative words serve as gateways to emotional states and unmet needs. These relationships can be formalized mathematically:
- **Input**: An evaluative word \( w \).
- **Output**: Predicted feelings \( F(w) = \{f_1, f_2, ..., f_k\} \) and needs \( N(w) = \{n_1, n_2, ..., n_m\} \).

#### **2. Clustering Relationships**
To map evaluative words to emotional clusters:
- Define a distance metric \( d(x, y) \) (e.g., cosine similarity for text embeddings) between evaluative words \( x \) and \( y \).
- Cluster \( F(w) \) based on \( \arg \min \sum_{x \in S_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2 \), where \( \mu_i \) is the cluster centroid.

#### **3. Real-Time Prediction**
A model \( M(w) \) must infer \( F(w) \) and \( N(w) \) efficiently:
\[
M(w) = \arg \max_{f, n} P(F(w) = f, N(w) = n | w; \theta)
\]
where \( \theta \) represents model parameters.

### **Summary**

1. **LDA**: Best for broad exploratory analysis and initial understanding of clusters in text.
2. **K-Means**: Effective for grouping similar Feeling(s) based on explicit features with straightforward implementation.
3. **Neural Network-Based Models**: Captures nuanced semantic relationships, suitable for contexts with rich data semantics.
4. **Fine-Tuned LLM**: Provides the most context-aware and adaptable solution but is computationally intensive and complex to implement.



### 1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Topic Modeling**
   **Purpose**: To identify clusters of Feeling(s) associated with each Evaluative Word and infer their Need(s).

   - **Steps**:
     1. Preprocess the dataset by tokenizing and stemming the Feeling(s) and Need(s).
     2. Use LDA to identify latent topics (clusters) based on keywords in Feeling(s).
     3. Map each Evaluative Word to the most likely topic based on the associated Feeling(s).
     4. Each topic is then linked to its corresponding Need(s).

   - **Advantage**: This probabilistic approach can model the hidden relationship between words in Feeling(s) and Needs, even if the connection is implicit or complex.

   - **Example**:
     - Input: "betrayed"
     - Topic Extraction: Keywords like "angry," "hurt," "disappointed," "enraged."
     - Output: Map these to "trust, dependability, honesty, honor, commitment, clarity."

---

### 2. **K-Means Clustering**
   **Purpose**: To create distinct clusters of Feeling(s) and assign Evaluative Words to these clusters.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Transform the Feeling(s) descriptions into high-dimensional vectors using methods like TF-IDF or Word2Vec.
     2. Use K-Means to create clusters based on vector similarities.
     3. Assign each Evaluative Word to the cluster of its associated Feeling(s).
     4. Each cluster is linked to the Need(s) it represents.

   - **Advantage**: Simplicity and effectiveness for clustering high-dimensional textual data, especially when the number of clusters is predefined.

   - **Example**:
     - Input: "belittled"
     - Cluster: Feeling(s) with similar vectors ("angry, frustrated, tense").
     - Output: Corresponding Need(s) like "respect, autonomy, acknowledgment."

---

### 3. **Neural Network-Based Embedding Models (BERT or Sentence Transformers)**
   **Purpose**: To create semantic embeddings for Feeling(s) and Need(s) and enable sophisticated mapping.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Use a pre-trained language model like BERT or Sentence Transformers to encode Feeling(s) and Need(s) into dense vectors.
     2. Use a clustering algorithm (e.g., Hierarchical Clustering) to group Feeling(s) embeddings.
     3. Develop a mapping function (e.g., a trained classifier) that links Evaluative Words to clusters of Feeling(s) and their corresponding Need(s).

   - **Advantage**: Captures deeper semantic relationships and contextual meanings between words and phrases.

   - **Example**:
     - Input: "manipulated"
     - Embedding Cluster: Similar Feeling(s) embeddings like "angry, powerless, thwarted."
     - Output: Corresponding Need(s): "autonomy, empowerment, freedom."

---

### **Implementation Considerations**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and removing stopwords for textual data.
   - Handle synonyms and polysemy in Feeling(s) and Need(s).

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Use metrics like Silhouette Score or Davies-Bouldin Index for clustering evaluation.
   - Evaluate accuracy with labeled data where available.

3. **Custom Ontology**:
   - A predefined structure of Feeling(s) and Need(s) (like in the NVC book) can serve as a baseline for mapping and validation.




### 1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Topic Modeling**

LDA is a probabilistic model that helps identify clusters of Feeling(s) and maps them to corresponding Need(s). Below is the Python implementation:

#### Python Code
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Step 1: Prepare the dataset
data = {
    'Evaluative Word': ['betrayed', 'belittled', 'manipulated'],
    'Feeling(s)': [
        'angry, hurt, disappointed, enraged',
        'angry, frustrated, tense, distressed',
        'angry, scared, powerless, thwarted, frustrated'
    ],
    'Need(s)': [
        'trust, dependability, honesty, honor, commitment, clarity',
        'respect, autonomy, acknowledgment, appreciation',
        'autonomy, empowerment, trust, equality, freedom, genuineness'
    ]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 2: Tokenize and preprocess the Feeling(s)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Feeling(s)'])

# Step 3: Fit the LDA model
n_topics = 3  # Number of topics
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=n_topics, random_state=42)
lda.fit(X)

# Step 4: Display topics
words = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for i, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):
    print(f"Topic {i + 1}:")
    print([words[i] for i in topic.argsort()[-5:]])

# Step 5: Assign Evaluative Words to clusters
topic_distribution = lda.transform(X)
df['Topic'] = topic_distribution.argmax(axis=1)
print(df)
```

---

### 2. **K-Means Clustering**

This method groups Feeling(s) into clusters and maps them to their respective Need(s).

#### Python Code
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Step 1: Prepare the dataset (same as above)
feelings = df['Feeling(s)']

# Step 2: Convert text to vectors using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(feelings)

# Step 3: Fit the K-Means model
n_clusters = 3
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Step 4: Display cluster centers (keywords)
terms = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for i, center in enumerate(kmeans.cluster_centers_):
    print(f"Cluster {i + 1}:")
    print([terms[j] for j in center.argsort()[-5:]])

# Step 5: Assign clusters to Evaluative Words
print(df[['Evaluative Word', 'Cluster']])
```

---

### 3. **Neural Network-Based Embedding Models (BERT or Sentence Transformers)**

This method uses contextual embeddings for clustering and mapping.

#### Python Code
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Step 1: Load the SentenceTransformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Step 2: Encode the Feeling(s)
embeddings = model.encode(df['Feeling(s)'].tolist())

# Step 3: Use Agglomerative Clustering
n_clusters = 3
clustering_model = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=n_clusters, affinity='cosine', linkage='complete')
df['Cluster'] = clustering_model.fit_predict(embeddings)

# Step 4: Display clusters
for cluster in range(n_clusters):
    cluster_words = df[df['Cluster'] == cluster]['Feeling(s)']
    print(f"Cluster {cluster + 1}:")
    print(cluster_words.tolist())

# Step 5: Map Evaluative Words to clusters
print(df[['Evaluative Word', 'Cluster']])
```

3. **Mapping**: Use the output of the models to map Evaluative Words to clusters of Feeling(s) and their corresponding Need(s).



### 1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Topic Modeling**

#### Mathematical Formula
LDA is a generative probabilistic model where:

1. **Generative Process**:
   - \( P(w|z) \): The probability of a word \( w \) belonging to a topic \( z \).
   - \( P(z|d) \): The probability of a topic \( z \) being present in a document \( d \).
   - \( P(w|d) = \sum_{z} P(w|z) P(z|d) \): The overall probability of word \( w \) in document \( d \).

2. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the likelihood: 
     \[
     P(W|Z, \beta, \theta) = \prod_{d=1}^D \prod_{n=1}^N \sum_{z=1}^K P(z|\theta_d) P(w_{d,n}|z, \beta)
     \]
   where \( \beta \) is the word distribution for topics, \( \theta \) is the topic distribution for documents, and \( w_{d,n} \) is the nth word in document \( d \).

#### Python Code
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Step 1: Prepare the dataset
data = {
    'Evaluative Word': ['betrayed', 'belittled', 'manipulated'],
    'Feeling(s)': [
        'angry, hurt, disappointed, enraged',
        'angry, frustrated, tense, distressed',
        'angry, scared, powerless, thwarted, frustrated'
    ],
    'Need(s)': [
        'trust, dependability, honesty, honor, commitment, clarity',
        'respect, autonomy, acknowledgment, appreciation',
        'autonomy, empowerment, trust, equality, freedom, genuineness'
    ]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 2: Tokenize and preprocess the Feeling(s)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Feeling(s)'])

# Step 3: Fit the LDA model
n_topics = 3  # Number of topics
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=n_topics, random_state=42)
lda.fit(X)

# Step 4: Display topics
words = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for i, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):
    print(f"Topic {i + 1}:")
    print([words[i] for i in topic.argsort()[-5:]])

# Step 5: Assign Evaluative Words to clusters
topic_distribution = lda.transform(X)
df['Topic'] = topic_distribution.argmax(axis=1)
print(df)
```

### 2. **K-Means Clustering**

#### Mathematical Formula
1. **Objective**: Minimize the within-cluster variance:
   \[
   \arg\min_S \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{x \in S_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2
   \]
   where:
   - \( S \): Clusters
   - \( \mu_i \): Centroid of cluster \( i \)
   - \( x \): Data point in the cluster.

2. **Centroid Update**:
   \[
   \mu_i = \frac{1}{|S_i|} \sum_{x \in S_i} x
   \]

---

#### Python Code
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Step 1: Prepare the dataset (same as above)
feelings = df['Feeling(s)']

# Step 2: Convert text to vectors using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(feelings)

# Step 3: Fit the K-Means model
n_clusters = 3
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Step 4: Display cluster centers (keywords)
terms = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for i, center in enumerate(kmeans.cluster_centers_):
    print(f"Cluster {i + 1}:")
    print([terms[j] for j in center.argsort()[-5:]])

# Step 5: Assign clusters to Evaluative Words
print(df[['Evaluative Word', 'Cluster']])
```

---

### 3. **Neural Network-Based Embedding Models (BERT or Sentence Transformers)**

#### Mathematical Formula
1. **Embedding Representation**:
   Sentence embeddings \( \mathbf{v}_s \) are computed as:
   \[
   \mathbf{v}_s = \text{BERT}(s)
   \]
   where \( s \) is the input sentence and \( \text{BERT}(s) \) is the output embedding.

2. **Cosine Similarity**:
   Used to measure the distance between two embeddings:
   \[
   \text{sim}(x, y) = \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\| \|\mathbf{y}\|}
   \]

3. **Clustering**:
   - Agglomerative clustering groups embeddings \( \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots \) based on cosine similarity.

---

#### Python Code
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Step 1: Load the SentenceTransformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Step 2: Encode the Feeling(s)
embeddings = model.encode(df['Feeling(s)'].tolist())

# Step 3: Use Agglomerative Clustering
n_clusters = 3
clustering_model = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=n_clusters, affinity='cosine', linkage='complete')
df['Cluster'] = clustering_model.fit_predict(embeddings)

# Step 4: Display clusters
for cluster in range(n_clusters):
    cluster_words = df[df['Cluster'] == cluster]['Feeling(s)']
    print(f"Cluster {cluster + 1}:")
    print(cluster_words.tolist())

# Step 5: Map Evaluative Words to clusters
print(df[['Evaluative Word', 'Cluster']])
```

---

### 4. **Fine-Tuning an LLM (Meta LLaMA 3 8B) for Mapping Evaluative Words to Feeling(s) and Need(s)**

#### Explanation
Fine-tuning a pre-trained large language model like Meta LLaMA 3 8B involves adapting the model to solve the problem of mapping **Evaluative Words** to **Feeling(s)** and **Need(s)**. By fine-tuning, we leverage the model's vast pre-trained knowledge and focus it on our specific dataset of emotional and evaluative language.

- The model learns to:
  - Identify clusters of **Feeling(s)** associated with **Evaluative Words**.
  - Predict corresponding **Need(s)** based on the context of **Evaluative Words** and their **Feeling(s)** clusters.
  - Generalize the mapping for unseen evaluative terms or nuanced language contexts.

---

#### Mathematical Formula
Fine-tuning involves minimizing a loss function \( \mathcal{L} \) that measures the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the ground truth. 

1. **Language Model Objective**:
   The fine-tuned objective adapts the causal language modeling objective:
   \[
   \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log P(y_i | x_i; \theta)
   \]
   Where:
   - \( N \): Number of training examples.
   - \( x_i \): Input prompt (Evaluative Word and associated Feeling(s)).
   - \( y_i \): Ground truth output (Need(s)).
   - \( \theta \): Model parameters.

2. **Fine-Tuning**:
   Optimize the model parameters \( \theta \) via gradient descent:
   \[
   \theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}
   \]
   Where \( \eta \) is the learning rate.

#### Python Code

Below is a step-by-step Python implementation for fine-tuning Meta LLaMA 3 8B using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

##### 1. Prepare the Dataset
The dataset includes examples of Evaluative Words, Feeling(s), and corresponding Need(s).

```python
import pandas as pd
from datasets import Dataset

# Step 1: Prepare the dataset
data = {
    "input": [
        "Evaluative Word: betrayed. Feeling(s): angry, hurt, disappointed, enraged.",
        "Evaluative Word: belittled. Feeling(s): angry, frustrated, tense, distressed.",
        "Evaluative Word: manipulated. Feeling(s): angry, scared, powerless, thwarted, frustrated."
    ],
    "output": [
        "Need(s): trust, dependability, honesty, honor, commitment, clarity.",
        "Need(s): respect, autonomy, acknowledgment, appreciation.",
        "Need(s): autonomy, empowerment, trust, equality, freedom, genuineness."
    ]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)
```

---

##### 2. Load the Pre-trained LLaMA Model
Load the Meta LLaMA 3 8B model and tokenizer.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

---

##### 3. Tokenize the Dataset
Prepare the input-output pairs for training.

```python
# Tokenize the dataset
def preprocess(data):
    return tokenizer(
        data["input"], 
        text_target=data["output"], 
        truncation=True, 
        max_length=512, 
        padding="max_length"
    )

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess, batched=True)
tokenized_dataset.set_format("torch")
```

---

##### 4. Fine-Tune the Model
Use the Hugging Face `Trainer` for fine-tuning.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./llama-finetuned",
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    save_steps=100,
    save_total_limit=2,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
    evaluation_strategy="no",
    report_to="none",
    fp16=True,  # Use mixed precision if supported
)

# Define the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

---

##### 5. Save and Evaluate the Fine-Tuned Model
Save the model and evaluate its performance.

```python
# Save the fine-tuned model
trainer.save_model("./llama-finetuned")

# Test the fine-tuned model
test_input = "Evaluative Word: betrayed. Feeling(s): angry, hurt, disappointed, enraged."
inputs = tokenizer(test_input, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
print("Generated Need(s):", tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

---

### Advantages of Fine-Tuning for This Problem
1. **Context Understanding**: LLaMA understands complex linguistic relationships, enabling nuanced mapping of Evaluative Words to Feeling(s) and Need(s).
2. **Generalization**: The fine-tuned model can generalize mappings to unseen words and scenarios.
3. **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets and complex relationships efficiently.


### Integration Chatbot

Here are the Gradio chatbot integrations for each of the four proposed solutions. Each chatbot processes user input, identifies the **Feeling(s)**, and reacts appropriately based on the respective solution's model.

---

    outputs="text",
    title="BERT-Based Emotional Understanding Chatbot",
    description="Chatbot that uses BERT embeddings to understand feelings and needs."
)

# Launch the chatbot
interface.launch()
```

---
